    <h1><strong> The Brown Bear</strong></h1>
    <p>The brown bear is the second-largest carnivore, after the polar bear and before the tiger. Adult males weigh about 400–600 kg (880–1,300 lb) and measure 2.4–3 m (8.7–10 ft) when standing. Females are much smaller. Brown bears have fur that is blond, brown, black, or a combination of these; the long outer hairs are often mixed with white or silver, creating a "grayish-brown" appearance. Brown bears have large humps of muscle on their shoulders, which power their forelimbs for digging. Their heads are large and round with a concave profile. Despite their heavy size, they can run at speeds of up to 64 km/h (40 mph).</p>
